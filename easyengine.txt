Installing Drush 7 using Composer

- See more detail at: http://whaaat.com/installing-drush-7-using-composer



I've recently come across this problem a few times while talking to friends and collegues. It seems people are still using Homebrew or other strange methods to try and get Drush installed locally. This is especially frustrating for people looking to get started with Drupal 8 development as it requires Drush 7. Using Composer is far and away the easiest method to install Drush.

First install Composer globally.

$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
$ export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
$ source ~/.bash_profile
Now that you have Composer working, you can install Drush 7 from the latest HEAD.

$ composer global require drush/drush:dev-master
To update Drush:

$ composer global update

Roll back to a release version of Drush

$ composer global require drush/drush:7.*
Install a specific version of Drush. For example: Drush 6.1.0

$ composer global require drush/drush:6.1.0
No really, we're done now.

You can now go back to doing whatever it is you were doing before you realized you needed to install Drush 7. :)

Step-by-step Installing Drupal 7 Manually
Step 1. Download and extract all drupal files into /var/www/ directory:

sudo -i
cd /var/www
wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-7.15.tar.gz
tar xvf drupal-7.15.tar.gz
mv drupal-7.15/ drupal
Step 2. Change an ownership of all Drupal installation files to www-data user.

chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www/drupal/

#Create a MySQL database to be used by our new Drupal 7 installation, Let’s create and use following credentials:

#Database: dbdrupal
#User: drupaluser
#Password: drupalpass


mysql -u root -p
create database dbdrupal;
CREATE USER drupaluser;
Create password: “drupalpass” for user: “drupaluser”

SET PASSWORD FOR drupaluser = PASSWORD("drupalpass");

#Grant user drupaluser all permissions on the database.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dbdrupal.* TO drupaluser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY "drupalpass";

#Logout from mysql server

quit


mysql -u root -p
create database wikidata;
CREATE USER huycan5369;
SET PASSWORD FOR huycan5369 = PASSWORD("qwe123AAA");
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wikidata.* TO huycan5369@localhost IDENTIFIED BY "qwe123AAA";


sudo chown -R www-data:www-data tat-ca-cac-file

sudo mv *.txt *.php *.html wp* ./backupsite

sudo chown -R pantasiov7_gmail_com:www-data /var/www/pantasio.com/
